# Financial-Modeling-and-Optimization

**Introduction**
A common passive equity money management strategy is indexing. When indexing, the goal is typically to choose a portfolio (index fund) that has similar movements to that of a market index such as the NASDAQ-100. In theory, a way to make an index fund that accomplishes this goal would be to purchase all the stocks in this index with the same weights that the index provides. However, doing this is quite impractical and costly due to the amount of recalculating this would take on a regular basis. Moreover, a more efficient strategy would be to create an index with a much smaller number of stocks, and thus different weights for each stock, that does an efficient job at tracking the larger index with less complications.
**Goal**
In this project, we've looked into the NASDAQ-100 index returns and its individual stocks from 2019 and 2020 as requested. Keeping in mind our limitations, we've put together a report that explains our analysis, decision-making, and weighted stock choices for the best possible Index Fund to follow the NASDAQ-100 closely. You'll find our code, charts, and some extra helpful information in the report.
